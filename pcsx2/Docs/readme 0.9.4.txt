PCSX2 is a PlayStation 2 emulator for Windows and Linux, started by the same team that brought you PCSX (a Sony PlayStation 1 emulator).

The PCSX2 project attempts to allow PS2 code to be executed on your computer, thus meaning you can put a PS2 DVD or CD into your computers drive, and boot it up!


Overview

The project has been running for more than five years now, and since it's initial release has grown in compatibility. From initially just being able to run a few public domain demos, it's current state enables many games to boot and actually go in game, such as the 'famous' Final Fantasy X or Devil May Cry 3. You can always visit the PCSX2 homepage (http://www.pcsx2.net) to check the latest compatibility status of games with more than 1800 titles tested.


Configuration

A very detailed guide is available on the PCSX2 homepage which is already translated in several languages!
You can consult it here: http://www.pcsx2.net/guide.php


Status

PCSX2 has come a long way since its’ starting point back at 2002.Current features include:

•Separate recompilers for Emotion Engine (EE) , Vector Unit 0 (VU0) and Vector Unit 1 (VU1).
•Dual core support, with the Graphics Synthesizer (GS) running on a second thread.
•Usage of MMX,SSE1,SSE2 and limited SSE3 extensions
•Proper SPU2 emulation featuring Auto DMA and Time Scaling
•Full gamepad support featuring Dual Shock 2,analog controls and even supporting analog movement over keyboard (using some external plugins)
•Patch system for creating cheats and for workarounds on games

Sections that still need work:

•Dev9 functions, such as HDD and Ethernet (partially implemented) support
•Firewire emulation (quite low on the list though)
•USB emulation (very partially implemented)
•Image Processing Unit (IPU) emulation which is responsible for the FMV playback.It has been implemented but it is buggy and slow
•MIPS cache needs to be properly implemented (barely works at this time)




How can you help

As most of you are aware, the PCSX2 team is working on this project at the expense of their free time and provide it without charging the program’s use.
If you want to show your appreciation to these people and motivate them, you can donate any amount of money you feel is right to the team’s paypal account found in the official site.
These funds will be used so the team members can get more modern and new hardware in order to test and debug more efficiently and even implement new features (just like dual core support for example).

If you are a programmer and you are interested in helping the PCSX2 team by making additions or corrections to the code, you are free to browse through the public SVN repository here (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcsx2) after taking into account PCSX2 is under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL) v2.

The Beta Tester Team

Beta testers are people (slaves/mindless grunts :P) who constantly test new PCSX2 beta builds to report any new bugs, regressions or improvements. While this might sound simple to most, what many people do not know is that testers also debug with the coders, maintain the huge game compatibility list, create dumps and logs for the coders and so much more. As above, active, inactive and ex members are listed alphabetically

Current active members:

Bositman, CKemu, Crushtest, Falcon4Ever, GeneralPlot, Prafull, RPGWizard, RudyX, Parotaku


Current inactive team members:

Belmont, Knuckles, Raziel


Ex team members:
Chaoscode, CpUMasteR, EFX , Elly, JegHegy, Razorblade, Seta San, Snake875
